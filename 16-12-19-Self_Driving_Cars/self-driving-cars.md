# A Catholic Reflection on the Morality of Self Driving Cars

*What's his name* in *this article* calls for the Catholic bishops to speak out about the development of self-driving cars. I want to begin the exercise of extracting the moral principles from Catholic teaching that may be relevant to this discussion. 




* determine what technology can distinguish, and then give a response to this
 * good, but to reactonary so need to start from first principles

* first principles are Catholic social teaching
 * dignity of human person
 * common good
  * Save a Catholic priest who helps thousands of people or a person who has cancer and is in pain and is just about to die. This might sound like an extreme example, but evidence suggests that the combination of big data and machine learning algorithms could legitimately make distinctions such as this and provide that information to the algorithms that determine how a self driving car operates. So...what is the common good...?


* talk about MIT morality experiment, which makes distinctions between (ranked in approximate descending order as to the clarity of the decision):
 * humans and animals (point to Genesis or anything else that establishes human dignigty as primary)
 * different numbers of people
 * people in the car and people outside the car
 * old people and young people (common good?)
 * good people and criminals (common good?)
 * people following traffic laws and people disobeying traffic laws



 ***Always, the decision is dependent on the level of technology. An outline of how to make decisions is only as good as the technology's ability to carry them out. Also, technology fails, resulting in needing to make decisions with not enough information or the inability to execute a desired decision. This speaks to the importance of those developing the technology understanding the moral implications of their work, how decision making is implemented, and how they need to order their focus on reliabiliy (or redundancy) to ensure that the most important decisions can be carried out.
