  1. “Your Holiness, many today think that life-long fidelity is too challenging; many feel that the struggle to live together may be beautiful, enchanting, but it is difficult, even impossible. We ask you for a word to enlighten us on this”.
    - "True love is the love that comes from God"
    - "How does one cure the fear of the 'forever'?...day by day"
    - "The Lord can multiply your love"
    - We need to repeat this prayer: "Lord give us this day our daily love."
  2. “Your Holiness, every day life together is beautiful, it gives joy, and support. But it is a challenge to face. We believe that we need to learn how to love one another. There is a “style” of life as a couple, a spirituality of daily life that we want to take on. Can you help us in this Holy Father?”
    - We must remember these 3 phrases:
    - May I? - courtesy kindles love
    - Thank you - remember that the other person is a gft from God
    - I'm sorry - never let the sun go down without making peace
  3. “Your Holiness, in these months we are preparing for our wedding. Can you give us some advice on how to celebrate our marriage well?”
    - "That which makes your wedding full and profoundly true will be the presence of the Lord who reveals himself and gives his grace"
    - "Make it so that, like the wine in Cana, the exterior signs of your [wedding] celebration reveal the Lord's presence and remind you and everyone present of the origin and the reason for your joy, [the Lord's blessing on your love]"

### Dr. Timothy O'Malley - The Nuptial Mystery: Divine Love and Human Salvation
[Dr. Timothy O'Malley](http://theology.nd.edu/people/concurrent-and-adjunct-faculty/timothy-omalley/) is the Directory of the [Notre Dame Center for Liturgy](http://liturgy.nd.edu/). Dr. O'Malley is a former professor of mine, and shared with me the syllabus for a course he taught (fall 2016) on marriage entitled "The Nuptial Mystery: Divine Love and Human Salvation." 

* [Course Description](https://class-search.nd.edu/reg/srch/ClassSearchServlet?CRN=20652&TERM=201610&P=401094): 

> "This course introduces students to the study of theology through attention to the sacrament of marriage. The structure of the course, drawn from the rite of marriage, seeks to understand the nature of divine and human love and how this love is salvific for the human person. The course, grounded in historical study, will introduce students to major sources for Christian theology. The class will treat themes related to a natural theology of love; the understanding of God as lover within the Scriptures and the Tradition; sexual ethics and a theology of family life; and, a spirituality of marriage in the modern age."

* [Course Books](http://www.bkstr.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/booklookServlet?bookstore_id-1=700&term_id-1=201610&div-1=&dept-1=THEO&course-1=20425&section-1=01)

I did not complete the full reading for the course, but found several books and essays helpful.
